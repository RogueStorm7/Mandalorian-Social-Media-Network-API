# Description
This Morally Engaged Social Media Network API uses **_MongoDB_** database. This allows mass amounts of data that is unstructured to be manageable for a website. I am using [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) which supports promises and callbacks as well as [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)   

# User Story

# Acceptance Criteria
